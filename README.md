# [Customer Segmentation Automobile - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tabriznagiyev/customer-segmentation-automobile)
## Project Overview
In this project we used collecting data, exploring features and distributions, treating data, understanding correlations, selecting relevant features, data modelling and presenting algorithms with metrics to select the best to predict the Customer Segmentation, what will help the business adopt the best marketing strategies to each of them and bring more market share and revenue to the company. 

* The chosen model was XGBoost since itÂ´s the most accurate.

# [A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners - Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/9b33b5af-164f-4744-9bac-4ccddcfcc28a)
## Project Overview
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?

Well, we're going to find out! The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. Let's load it in and take a look.

# [The Android App Market on Google Play - Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/839be540-29ac-46bb-90ee-17df3e0aef14)
## Project Overview
Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.
